                <p>
                    Bodybuilding has been in my life since I was 15 and was put in the weightroom during PE class in highschool. Before then, I identified as a shy intellect and did not think I would ever grow to be a muscular or confident person. Bodybuilding changed my life in that it helped reframe my mindset around who I am and who I can be. Not only is it a physical journey but it's also a journey of shaping my mind - if I can work on my body, I can work on my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been on and off bodybuilding ever since then, but recently I have been insanely consistent, going to the gym 3-4 times a week for the past few months and for this month of December, going literally every day. I've learned to workout even if I am sore, I'm testing out different body part splits, and overall feeling amazing from the consistency of attacking the weights. It's a place for me to let out my physical aspirations and an expression of how I feel inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of goals, this next year of 2023 will finally be the first time in my life I'll have abs. I don't want to identify as the large guy anymore, even if that means losing a significant muscle mass. I need to renew myself and evolve. I need to become the strongest version of myself - stronger than even now - and really build my body to the point of peak performance.
