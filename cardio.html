                <p>
                    Like most gym bros, I have always hated cardio exercise. It's not necessarily a hate, but the nature of cardio exercise is much more grueling than pumping weights and feeling a more instant gratification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cardio exercise being long and endurance based, it's more of a mind battle than anything else. Most of the time when I'm doing cardio, after about 20 minutes I can't even feel more fatigued than I already am, at which point it's just a time battle. When I hit that point, I can usually go anywhere from 30-60 minutes of straight cardio without stopping, that is of course unless my mind gives in first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point in my life, I am doing more cardio exercises than I ever have. I make sure to do cardio every single day when I go to the gym, and if it's a rest day at home I will still do a 20-30 minute cardio exercise in the form of shadow boxing. It's definitely a week point in my physique but if I'm going to have abs for the first time ever then I know this is not an area I can skip. Plus of course you don't want to have the body of a Greek God but being completely unhealthy inside. Cardio is necessary and I'm happy that I am able to overcome the physical and mental battle every day.
