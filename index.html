                    The <b>Training of Thongster</b> is my documented journey from a mediocre physique to that of a <b>Greek God</b>. Through consistent weight training, cardiovascular exercise, and a proper diet, the development of my very human body at the age of 26 will become the best it has ever been.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only is it a physical journey, it arguable a more mental journey and a battle within my own mind. Breaking the chains of my old mindset about myself, through changing my body I am also changing my habitual thought patterns and how I view myself as a person. I'm practicing the discipline it takes to reform oneself physically. Although this is Training Thongster and this is very much about my physical activites, it is my mental thoughts and wavelengths which will be trained the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I must first control the mental in order to change the physical. <um>My physical training and my body transformation is only a measure of how discplined I have become and who I am inside as a man.</u>

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. - Theodore Roosevelt",
