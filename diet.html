                    The bane of my entire body transformation - the diet. Historically and still to this day, diet has been my weakest area and has been difficult to get under control. I'm not entirely sure why, but I have a very unhealthy relationship with food and portion control and as they say, diet is the most important part of training! Therefore this is the area I need to be concentrating on the most.

                    Perhaps it's from growing up and having less, being taught that I need to eat every last grain of rice on my plate when being fed. Perhaps it's from my pot smoking days i.e. the munchies where I would devour all the food in my mom's fridge on those late nights. Perhaps it's just a form of comfort that I find after a long day, or any day really - I don't have many vices but food is definitely my drug of choice.

                    Only once in 2019 when I was on my last cutting cycle did I really gain control over my overeating problem. But still, I reverted back into old habits and my traditional ways. Although food is the most physical part of my body transformation, it will be the toughest mental battle for me to overcome. But I'm not backing down from that challenge! If I can't control what goes into my body then how can I expect to control anything in my life? It's the most basic of human behaviours and I refuse to lose to myself on this one. It's going to happen!!!
