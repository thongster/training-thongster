                <p>
                    My strenght training journey has always been hand in hand with my bodybuilding journey. However, recently I took on a 6 week strength program to really concentrate on strength. This has been amazing experience to push my body and mind past certain weight limits which I had before.

                <p>
                    Usually when weight training without pushing my strength limits in mind, I'll casually increase the weight when I feel like it. This is not regimented and often gets thrown aside to what I feel like doing instead. To have a program tell me what to do and what is expected of me based on my previous max lifts, it was definitely barrier breaking. Nothing better than lifting heavy and actually being able to get the weight up!
                </p>

                    There is a serious mental block when it comes to strength training. Because you're lifting such heavy weights, it's sometimes easy to only do 1-2 sets and go lighter, or space out your strength work outs over a couple weeks as to not feel physically drained. Having a strength program to tell you what to do and when really helped to lift those mental glass ceilings. It's taught me to squat and deadlift on the same day, and do many of the other compound movements on the same day as each other as well. You can do more than you think you can.
